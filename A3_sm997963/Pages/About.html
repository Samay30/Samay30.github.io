         My name is Samay Bhojwani and I was born and raised in India. From a very young age, I was deeply passionate about logic and machines.
          Math was my best friend in school, because of Math I got interested in coding and Computer Science. After finishing school, I went to Canada to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Dalhousie University.
          Apart from my experience in Google and Microsoft, I have had a ton of experience with freelancing, I have fullfilled over 100 clients in my freelance career(web designing, backend developement and many more).
